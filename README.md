# Zoo-Model
The final project for an Object Oriented Programming course.

The zoo model consists of multiple areas, each of which can be identified by a unique ID. There is
exactly one entrance area, which always has an ID of zero. Any number of picnic areas and animal
habitats may be added to (or removed from) the zoo. Areas can be connected and visited.

Aquariums can accommodate seals, sharks and starfish, while lions, gazelles
and zebra are kept in enclosures. Buzzards and parrots must be caged. Some animals are
incompatible with each other.

Finally, the zoo has a ticket machine which sells tickets and gives change.

My aim was to use inheritance and a well chosen class hierarchy for a clean design.
